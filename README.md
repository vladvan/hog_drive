# Hog Drive

**Hemi-spherical Omni-Directional Gimbal Drive**

This repository contains the cad models, bill of materials, stl files and all of files/instructions to add an FRC legal "Hog Drive" to your robot. The Hog drive is innovative and compact, and features a continous variable transmission with super nimble movement.

As the design evolves, please check back for more information. At this point, the conceptual model is complete and we are moving to create a concrete working model. The CAD models will be updated with small tweaks and adjustments as well as any improvments we find doing testing.

Please look at [VIEWME](VIEWME.stl) file to see the outer shell of the Hog drive. It gives you a arough idea of what the Hog drive looks like, and how it is meant to work. The outer "sphere" is roughly 8 inches in diameter and the lower part spinas arouns and makes contact with the ground.

Of course the are many more pieces to this design, so take a look at the [hog_drive_cad.fcstd](hog_drive_cad.fcstd) file using FreeCAD to see the design in its entirety. 

The [bill of materials](hog_drive_bom.ods) is a work in progress, and created in LibreOffice.

Please note: I will not export the FreeCAD design to any other CAD program. It offends my sensibilites.
