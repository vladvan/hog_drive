# Hog Drive

**Hemi-spherical Omni-Directional Gimbal Drive**

This repository contains the cad models, bill of materials, and stl files for an FRC legal "wheel". It is compact in its design, and features a continous variable transmission.

Please look at the [VIEWME.stl](VIEWME) file to see the outer shell. Of course the are many more prices to the design, so take a look at the [hog_drive_cad.fcstd](hog_drive_cad) file using FreeCAD to see the design in its entirety.

The [hog_drive_bom.ods](Bill Of Materials) is a work in progress, and created in LibreOfffice.

Please note: I will not export the FreeCAD design to any othe CAD program. It offends my sensibilites.
