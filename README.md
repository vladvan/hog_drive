# Hog Drive

**Hemi-spherical Omni-Directional Gimbal Drive**

This repository contains the cad models, bill of materials, stl files and related files to add an FRC legal "wheel" to your robot. The Hog drive is innocative, compact, and features a continous variable transmission.

As the design evolves, please check back for more information. At this point, the conceptual model is complete and is moving to create a conrete working model. So the CAD model will be updated with small tweaks and adjustments.

Please look at [VIEWME](VIEWME.stl) file to see the outer shell of the Hog drive. The outer "sphere" is roughly 8 inches in diameter.

Of course the are many more prices to the design, so take a look at the [hog_drive_cad.fcstd](hog_drive_cad.fcstd) file using FreeCAD to see the design in its entirety.

The [bill of materials](hog_drive_bom.ods) is a work in progress, and created in LibreOfffice.

Please note: I will not export the FreeCAD design to any othe CAD program. It offends my sensibilites.
